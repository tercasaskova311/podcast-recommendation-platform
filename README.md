# Podcast Analytics & Recommendation Platform

This project builds an end-to-end data pipeline to recommend podcast episodes to users based on their interactions and also podcasts content. The workflow includes:

- Downloading new podcast episodes
- Analyzing transcripts
- Tracking user behavior (events)
- Training recommendation models
- Delivering real-time personalized recommendation for a podcasts episode

## Architecture

## Architecture Diagram

![Architecture Diagram](./docs/project_architecture.png)

### Ingest

* Fetch trending episodes from PodcastIndex.com → publish to Kafka (`episode-metadata`, `episode-ids`)
* Sequential downloader/transcriber writes **episodes** & **transcripts** to **Delta**
* User Event simulation - in order to recreate real life data (Stream processing)

### Training / Analytics

* Aggregate **user events** (stream/micro-batch) into **Delta**
* Train **user events** via ALS (Spark ML) to get episode recommendation based on user events

* Batch procesing: Loading transcript text data from Delta and training them 
* Traning transcript data - output: text embedings = text similarities, recomputed each time batch is running 


### Serving

* **MongoDB** stores the `final_recommendations` data which combine similarities recommendation + user event recommendation
* **Streamlit** reads **Mongo** (final_recommendation) + **Delta** (user_events “last N minutes”, episodes metadata) via **DuckDB**

## Prerequisites

* **Docker Desktop** (with Compose)
* Free local ports for services (Kafka, Mongo, Spark UI, Airflow UI, Streamlit)
* If your network uses a corporate/VPN proxy, ensure Docker can pull from Docker Hub (see **Troubleshooting**)

# HOW TO RUN THE INFRASTRUCTURE

1. Run **make init** (wait until it finishes).  
   The only container that should be stopped after this command is `airflow-airflow-init-1` (it is only used to initialize Airflow).  

2. Connect to the Airflow interface at `http://localhost:8081`  
   (username: `airflow`, password: `airflow`).  
   Go to **Admin > Connections**, search for `spark_default`, click **Edit parameter**, and change the value in the **host** field to `local[*]`. Save it.  

3. Go to the **DAGs** page, run the demo DAG that initializes the system, and once it has finished, run the recommendation DAG.

### LAST STEP  
After these operations, we have simulated the functionality of the system.  
To check the results, go to `http://localhost:8084`.
